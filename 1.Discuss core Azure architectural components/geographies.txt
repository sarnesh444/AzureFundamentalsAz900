Azure divides the world into geographies that are defined by geopolitical boundaries or country borders.
An Azure geography is a discrete market typically containing two or more regions that preserves data residency and compliance boundaries.


Geographies allow customers with specific data residency and compliance needs to keep their data and applications close.
Geographies ensure that data residency, sovereignty, compliance, and resiliency requirements are honored within geographical boundaries.
Geographies are fault-tolerant to withstand complete region failure through their connection to dedicated high-capacity networking infrastructure.


Americas
Europe
Asia Pacific
Middle East and Africa

Each region belongs to a single geography and has specific service availability, compliance, and data residency/sovereignty rules applied to it.
