Availability Zones
------------------
You want to ensure your services and data are redundant so you can protect your information in case of failure.
When you are hosting your infrastructure, this requires creating duplicate hardware environments.
Azure can help make your app highly available through Availability Zones.

Availability zones  are physically separate locations within an Azure region that use availability sets to provide additional fault tolerance.



Availability Zone features
--------------------------

Each availability zone is an isolation boundary containing one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking.

If one availability zone goes down, the other continues working.

The availability zones are typically connected to each other through very fast, private fiber-optic networks.

Availability zones allow customers to run mission-critical applications with high availability and low-latency replication.

Availability zones are offered as a service within Azure, and to ensure resiliency, thereâ€™s a minimum of three separate zones in all enabled regions.
