A region  is a geographical area on the planet containing at least one, 
but potentially multiple datacenters that are in close proximity and networked together with a low-latency network.


For most Azure services, when you deploy a resource in Azure, you choose the region where you want your resource to be deployed.





SPECIAL AZURE REGIONS
---------------------

Special Azure regions
Azure has specialized regions that you might want to use when building out your applications for compliance or legal purposes. These include:


US DoD Central, US Gov Virginia, US Gov Iowa and more:
-----------------------------------------------------
These are physical and logical network-isolated instances of Azure for US government agencies and partners.
These datacenters are operated by screened US persons and include additional compliance certifications.

China East, China North and more:
---------------------------------
These regions are available through a unique partnership between Microsoft and 21Vianet, whereby Microsoft does not directly maintain the datacenters.






REGION PAIRS
------------

It's possible that a large enough disaster could cause an outage large enough to affect even two datacenters.
That's why Azure creates region pairs.
Each Azure region is paired with another region within the same geography (such as US, Europe, or Asia) at least 300 miles away,which together make a region pair.
The exception is Brazil South, which is paired with a region outside its geography.




Physical isolation
------------------
When possible, Azure prefers at least 300 miles of separation between datacenters in a regional pair, although this isn't practical or possible in all geographies.
Physical datacenter separation reduces the likelihood of natural disasters, civil unrest, power outages, or physical network outages affecting both regions at once.

Platform-provided replication.
------------------------------
Some services such as Geo-Redundant Storage provide automatic replication to the paired region.

Region recovery order.
---------------------
In the event of a broad outage, recovery of one region is prioritized out of every pair.
Applications that are deployed across paired regions are guaranteed to have one of the regions recovered with priority.

Sequential updates.
-------------------
Planned Azure system updates are rolled out to paired regions sequentially (not at the same time) to minimize downtime, the effect of bugs,
and logical failures in the rare event of a bad update.
