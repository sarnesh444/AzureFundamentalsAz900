1.SINGLE VM
A single virtual machine with premium storage has an SLA of 99.9%. 
You can quickly migrate existing virtual machines to Azure through “lift and shift”. 
Lift and shift is a no-code option where each application is migrated as-is, providing the benefits of the cloud without the risks or costs of making code changes.



2.AVAILABILITY SETS
By placing virtual machines in an availability set, you protect against datacenter failures and increases the SLA to 99.95%.



3.AVAILABILITY ZONES
Adding virtual machines to availability zones protects from entire datacenter failures and increases the SLA to 99.99%,
which is highest level of protection that is provided.



4.REGION PAIRS
For multi-region disaster recovery, region pairs protect and provide data residency boundaries.
