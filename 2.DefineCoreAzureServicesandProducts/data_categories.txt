Data categories in Azure
You can generally think of data as structured, semi-structured, and unstructured.

Structured data
---------------
Structured data is data that adheres to a schema, so all the data has the same fields or properties.
Structured data can be stored in a database table with rows and columns.
Structured data relies on keys to indicate how one row in a table relates to data in another row of another table.
Structured data is also known as relational data. The data's schema defines the table of data, the fields in the table, and the clear relationship between the two.
Structured data is easy to enter, query, and analyze because all the data follows the same format.
Examples of structured data include sensor data or financial data.

Semi-structured data
--------------------
Semi-structured data is less organized than structured data.
Semi-structured data is not stored in a relational format, meaning the fields do not neatly fit into tables, rows, and columns.
Semi-structured data contains tags that make the organization and hierarchy of the data apparent.
Semi-structured data is also known as non-relational or NoSQL data.
Examples of semi-structured data include books, blogs, and HTML documents.


Unstructured data
-----------------
Unstructured data has no designated structure.
Unstructured data can hold any kind of data.
Unstructured data is becoming more prominent as businesses try to tap into new data sources.
Examples of unstructured data include a PDF document, a JPG image, a JSON file, and video content.
