CONTAINER
---------

If you wish to run multiple instances of an application on a single host machine, 
containers are an excellent choice. The container orchestrator can start, stop, and scale out application instances as needed.

Containers are a virtualization environment.

Containers reference the operating system of the host environment that runs the container.
Unlike virtual machines you do not manage the operating system.
Containers are lightweight and are designed to be created, scaled out, and stopped dynamically.
Containers allows you to respond to changes on demand and quickly restart in case of a crash or hardware interruption.
Azure supports Docker containers.


Azure Container Instances 
-------------------------
 
offers the fastest and simplest way to run a container in Azure without having 
to manage any virtual machines or adopt any additional services.
It is a PaaS offering that allows you to upload your containers, which it will run for you.


Azure Kubernetes Service
-------------------------

The task of automating, managing, and interacting with a large number of containers is known as orchestration. 
Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)  is a complete orchestration service for containers with distributed architectures and large volumes of containers. 
Orchestration is the task of automating and managing a large number of containers and how they interact.


Use containers in your solutions
--------------------------------
Containers are often used to create solutions using a microservice architecture.
This architecture is where you break solutions into smaller, independent pieces. 
For example, you may split a website into a container hosting your front end, another hosting your back end, and a third for storage.
This split allows you to separate portions of your app into logical sections that can be maintained, scaled, or updated independently.
