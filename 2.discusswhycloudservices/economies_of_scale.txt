The concept of economies of scale is the ability to reduce costs and gain efficiency when operating at a larger scale in comparison to operating at a smaller scale.


This is apparent to end users in a number of ways, 
one of which is the ability to acquire hardware at a lower cost than if a single user or smaller business were purchasing it.

Storage costs, for example, have decreased significantly over the last decade due in part to cloud providers' 
ability to purchase larger amounts of storage at significant discounts.
They are then able to use that storage more efficiently and pass on those benefits to end users in the form of lower prices.
