IaaS
----


Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is the most basic category of cloud computing services. 
With IaaS, you rent IT infrastructure servers and virtual machines (VMs), storage, networks, and operating systems from a cloud provider on a pay-as-you-go basis. 
It's an instant computing infrastructure, provisioned and managed over the internet.


IaaS characteristics
--------------------

Upfront costs. IaaS has no upfront costs. Users pay only for what they consume.

User ownership. The user is responsible for the purchase, installation, configuration, and management of their own software operating systems, middleware, and applications.

Cloud provider ownership. The cloud provider is responsible for ensuring that the underlying cloud infrastructure (such as virtual machines, storage and networking) is available for the user.


Shared responsibility in IaaS
-----------------------------

When using IaaS, ensuring that a service is up and running is a shared responsibility: 
the cloud provider is responsible for ensuring the cloud infrastructure is functioning correctly; 
the cloud customer is responsible for ensuring the service they are using is configured correctly, is up to date, and is available to their customers.
