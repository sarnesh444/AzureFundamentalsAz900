PaaS
----

Platform as a Service (PaaS) provides an environment for building, testing, and deploying software applications. 
The goal of PaaS is to help create an application as quickly as possible without having to worry about managing the underlying infrastructure.
For example, when deploying a web application using PaaS, you don't have to install an operating system, web server, or even system updates.
PaaS is a complete development and deployment environment in the cloud, with resources that enable organizations to deliver everything from simple cloud-based apps 
to sophisticated cloud-enabled enterprise applications.

Resources are purchased from a cloud service provider on a pay-as-you-go basis and accessed over a secure Internet connection.



PaaS characteristics
--------------------

Upfront costs.
-------------
There are no upfront costs, and users pay only for what they consume.

User ownership.
---------------
The user is responsible for the development of their own applications. 
However, they are not responsible for managing the server or infrastructure. This allows the user to focus on the application or workload they want to run.

Cloud provider ownership. 
------------------------
The cloud provider is responsible for operating system management, and network and service configuration. 
Cloud providers are typically responsible for everything apart from the application that a user wants to run.
They provide a complete managed platform on which to run an application.
